## Introduction

The goal of this guide is to help you migrate from using Redux for state management to leveraging the power of React Hooks. This repository contains a series of commits that demonstrate the step-by-step process of replacing Redux with a custom hook-based state management solution.

## Getting Started with a Custom Hook as a Store
